    <h1>We Raced Further.</h1>
    <p>
        Organizing any event is never easy, especially when it comes to setting up an expedition-type adventure race that involves so many variables beyond the organizer's control, such as weather conditions, terrain challenges, the racers' reactions to the course, and timing. Despite these difficulties, we strive to overcome them in the spirit of adventure racing, with the aim of promoting the sport, the location, and the culture.

        I believe that adventure racing should be about more than just producing strong and competitive racers. Rather, it should aim to develop wholesome and respectful individuals, using the challenges encountered during the race as metaphors for life’s difficulties. Ultimately, we should all come out of the experience as better people, having met, accepted, and conquered the challenges along the way.

        It has always been a dream to host an international adventure race and to showcase a homegrown race to the world. For this reason, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the great success of this event, including the racers, marshals, medical staff, coast guards, security personnel, administrative and logistics staff, and all the other volunteers. To make this goal come true, they all went above and beyond what was required of them. As the adage goes, “The thing that stand between a Mans’ life and his dream is often merely the will to try it, and the faith to believe it is possible.” (Richard Devos)
